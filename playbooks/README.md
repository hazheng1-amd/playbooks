# Playbook Creation Guide
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This guide covers **how to write a playbook**. Before you write one, the idea has to be approved: open a [playbook proposal](https://github.com/amd/playbooks/issues/new?template=playbook_proposal.yml) with a short abstract and wait for AMD maintainers to label it `status::approved`. Pull requests that add a playbook without an approved proposal will be closed. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full process and what reviewers look for.

## Design Principles

**A playbook is not a setup guide.** Users should feel accomplished when they finish. They should feel they learned something meaningful, built something real, and can't wait to explore further.

### Core Guidelines

1. **Create a moment of success.** Users should *see something happen*: an image appears, a model responds, a server comes alive.
2. **Teach, don't just instruct.** Explain *why* things work, not just which buttons to click.
3. **Spark curiosity.** End with "Next Steps" that open doors to further exploration.
4. **Respect the reader.** Be concise, be clear, and trust them to follow along.

### Reference Example

See `playbooks/core/comfyui-image-gen/README.md` for a well-structured playbook that demonstrates these principles. See [Previewing](#previewing) to view it in the browser.

## Folder Structure

```text
playbooks/
├── core/                    # Essential playbooks for getting started
├── supplemental/            # Additional playbooks for specific use cases
├── backup/                  # Unpublished/draft playbooks
└── README.md                # This file
```

Each playbook lives in its own folder:

```text
playbook-name/
├── playbook.json            # Metadata (required)
├── README.md                # Content (required)
├── platform.md              # Platform configurations (required for core, optional for supplemental)
└── assets/                  # Images and files (optional)
```


### Assets

Reference images using relative paths:

```markdown
![Screenshot](assets/screenshot.png)
```

- Max 500 KB per file
- Formats: PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, SVG
- Include screenshots at key UI moments

---

## The `README.md` File

Write your playbook content in Markdown format. Images, tables, code, and other elements are supported.

**Recommended structure:**

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Overview** | What is this tool? Why is it exciting? (2-3 sentences) |
| **What You'll Learn** | 3-5 concrete outcomes |
| **Getting Started** | First hands-on step—get users into the tool quickly |
| **Core Concepts** | Teach the mental model (tables and diagrams help) |
| **Main Activity** | Where users achieve the payoff moment |
| **Next Steps** | 3-5 paths forward with links to resources and official documentation |

### OS-Specific Content

Use HTML comments to mark platform-specific sections:

```markdown
<!-- @os:windows -->
Windows-only content
<!-- @os:end -->

<!-- @os:linux -->
Linux-only content
<!-- @os:end -->
```

Content outside `@os` tags is always shown. Keep blocks focused—only tag the parts that differ.

### Device-Specific Content

Use `@device` tags for instructions that apply to specific hardware. Supports comma-separated values to target multiple devices:

```markdown
<!-- @device:halo -->
STX Halo-only instructions
<!-- @device:end -->

<!-- @device:halo,stx -->
Instructions for both Halo and STX Point
<!-- @device:end -->

<!-- @device:rx7900xt,rx9070xt,r9700 -->
Instructions for discrete Radeon GPUs
<!-- @device:end -->
```

| Device ID | Hardware | Product Name |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| `halo_box` | STX Halo | AMD Ryzen™ AI Halo Developer Platform |
| `halo` | STX Halo | AMD Ryzen™ AI Max+ |
| `stx` | STX Point | AMD Ryzen™ AI 300 HX |
| `krk` | Krackan Point | AMD Ryzen™ AI 300 |
| `rx7900xt` | Radeon RX 7900 XT | AMD Radeon™ 7000 Series Graphics |
| `rx9070xt` | Radeon RX 9070 XT | AMD Radeon™ 9000 Series Graphics |
| `r9700` | Radeon AI Pro R9700 | AMD Radeon™ 9000 Series Graphics |

Content outside `@device` tags is always shown. Use `<!-- @device:all -->` to explicitly mark content for all devices. A device selector appears on the playbook page when `@device` tags are detected.

### Shared Content Tags

Use these tags to pull in shared content from `playbooks/dependencies/`. Both reference items defined in `registry.json`.

| Tag | Purpose | Display |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `@require` | Pre-installed software | Collapsible dropdown (optional info) |
| `@setup` | System configuration steps | Displayed directly (required steps) |

**Pre-installed software** — Use `@require` for software that comes pre-installed on the AMD Halo Developer Platform:

```markdown
<!-- @require:comfyui -->
<!-- @require:comfyui,pytorch -->   <!-- multiple dependencies in one dropdown -->
```

Displays a green checkmark with "Already pre-installed on your AMD Ryzen™ AI Halo Developer Platform!" that expands to show manual installation instructions.

**System setup** — Use `@setup` for configuration steps users need to perform:

```markdown
<!-- @setup:memory_config -->
```

Content displays directly since these are required steps, not optional reference info.

### Writing Tips

- List prerequisites upfront. Don't surprise users mid-playbook
- Include expected output so users know what success looks like
- Keep code blocks copy-friendly (avoid `$` or `>` prompts)
- Follow the [AMD Branding Guide](AMD_BRANDING_GUIDE.md) for correct product naming and trademark usage

### AMD Product Branding

When referencing AMD products in your playbooks, follow the [AMD Branding Guide](AMD_BRANDING_GUIDE.md) to ensure consistent and correct usage:

- **First mention**: Use the full product name with trademark symbol (™)
- **Subsequent mentions**: Use the approved shortened form
- **JSON files**: Use `\u2122` for trademark symbols instead of typing ™ directly

---

## The `platform.md` File

Documents pre-installed software, model paths, and platform-specific prerequisites. **Required for `core` playbooks**, since they assume dependencies are preinstalled on the system. Optional for `supplemental` playbooks.

See `playbooks/core/comfyui-image-gen/platform.md` for an example.

---

## Editing a Playbook

To edit an existing playbook:

1. Navigate to the appropriate folder (e.g., `playbooks/core/lmstudio-rocm-llms/`)
2. Edit the `playbook.json` file to update metadata
3. Edit the `README.md` file to update content

> **Note:** Only create a new playbook folder if your [proposal](https://github.com/amd/playbooks/issues/new?template=playbook_proposal.yml) has been labeled `status::approved`. Name it after the `id` you agreed on in the proposal, and place it under `core/` or `supplemental/` as directed in the review.

---

## The `playbook.json` File

```json
{
  "id": "my-playbook",
  "title": "My Playbook Title",
  "description": "Brief description for the card (100-150 chars)",
  "time": 45,
  "supported_platforms": { "halo": ["windows", "linux"] },
  "difficulty": "intermediate",
  "published": true,
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]
}
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | Yes | Must match folder name |
| `title` | Yes | Display title |
| `description` | Yes | Card description (100–150 characters) |
| `time` | Yes | Completion time in minutes |
| `supported_platforms` | Yes | Device → OS map controlling which platforms/devices appear in the UI, e.g. `{ "halo": ["windows", "linux"] }` |
| `tested_platforms` | No | Device → OS map of CI-tested combinations, e.g. `{ "halo": ["windows", "linux"], "krk": ["linux"] }` |
| `required_platforms` | No | Subset of `tested_platforms` where CI failure blocks merges |
| `published` | Yes | Set `true` to show on website |
| `difficulty` | No | `"beginner"`, `"intermediate"`, or `"advanced"` |

| `isFeatured` | No | Displays prominently at top |
| `tags` | No | Keywords for filtering |

---

## Testing

You are expected to add tests for your playbook in the same pull request. Wrap the playbook's own commands in `@test` tags and fill in `tested_platforms`, as described in the [Playbook Testing Guide](TESTING.md).
